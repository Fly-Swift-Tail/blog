**Flying private doesn't always mean paying full price.** Empty leg flights—when jets reposition without passengers—can offer **savings of 50-75% off standard charter rates**. The catch? These deals disappear fast, and finding them means monitoring dozens of operator websites daily.

**We're changing that.**

## What Are Empty Leg Flight Alerts?

Our new **Empty Leg Alerts** feature monitors the top private aviation sources and notifies you the moment a flight matches your route. Set your home airport, preferred destinations, and travel dates—**we'll do the rest**.

## How Empty Leg Alerts Work

### 1. Set Your Parameters

Tell us your home city and we'll map it to nearby private airports. For **NYC-area travelers**, that includes **Teterboro (TEB)**, Westchester (HPN), Farmingdale (FRG), and more.

### 2. Choose Your Destinations

Select from pre-built corridor options based on the **busiest private jet routes**:

- **South Florida** - Miami-Opa Locka (OPF), Palm Beach (PBI), Fort Lauderdale (FLL)
- **Los Angeles** - Van Nuys (VNY), Burbank (BUR)
- **Chicago** - Midway (MDW)
- **DC Area** - Dulles (IAD), Manassas (HEF)
- **Boston** - Hanscom Field (BED)

### 3. Get Instant Notifications

We scan **10+ major operators and brokers**—including XO, VistaJet, Air Charter Service, Clay Lacy, and Priester Aviation—multiple times per day. When a match appears, you'll receive an alert with **aircraft details, timing, and a direct link to book**.

## Why These Private Jet Routes?

We focused on the **highest-traffic corridors** first. **Teterboro (TEB) is the busiest private jet airport in the U.S.**, with heavy flows to South Florida and the West Coast. The **TEB–South Florida corridor sees the most repositioning flights**, making it prime territory for empty leg opportunities.

The **TEB–Van Nuys transcontinental route** is another workhorse, frequently generating deals as jets move between coasts.

## Important Information About Empty Leg Bookings

**Empty leg availability changes rapidly.** Aircraft may be booked, repositioned, or cancelled between our scan and your booking attempt. We provide **direct links to operator listings**—you'll always book directly with the provider, never through us.

We respect each source's terms of service and use only publicly available listings.

## What's Coming Next

We're starting with **NYC-area departures** and the five busiest corridors. Summer destinations like the **Hamptons** (East Hampton, Westhampton) and **Nantucket** will be added in Q2 2025, when seasonal repositioning creates more opportunities.
