**The private aviation industry just changed forever.** For the first time, charter customers can see **real-time empty leg flights** across the United States on a single, interactive map. No more hunting through dozens of operator websites. No more missing deals because you didn't know they existed.

**Welcome to the future of empty leg tracking.**

## A Quantum Leap in Private Aviation Transparency

Today marks a historic milestone for **Fly Swift Tail** and the private aviation community. Our new **Flight Radar** transforms how travelers discover and book empty leg flights, bringing **unprecedented transparency** to an industry that has operated behind closed doors for decades.

This isn't just another flight tracker—it's a **real-time intelligence platform** that puts the power of information directly into the hands of charter customers, making private aviation more accessible than ever before.

## What Flight Radar Delivers

### Live Empty Leg Intelligence
Our radar displays **repositioning flights in real-time** across the continental United States. Every aircraft icon represents a genuine empty leg opportunity—a private jet moving without passengers, available for charter at **dramatically reduced rates**.

### Advanced Aircraft Filtering
Not all private jets are created equal. Filter by aircraft category to match your mission:

- **Light Jets** - Citation CJ series, Phenom 100/300, Learjet 75 (4-7 passengers)
- **Midsize Jets** - Citation XLS+, Hawker 900XP, Learjet 60 (6-9 passengers)  
- **Super Midsize** - Citation X, Falcon 2000, G280 (8-12 passengers)
- **Heavy Jets** - Challenger 650, Falcon 7X, G550 (10-16 passengers)
- **Ultra Long Range** - G650ER, Global 7500, Falcon 8X (12-19 passengers)

### Intelligent Date Range Selection
Plan ahead with **flexible date filtering**. Whether you need a flight today, next week, or next month, our radar shows available empty legs across your entire travel window. Perfect for travelers with flexibility who want to **maximize savings**.

### Route-Based Discovery
Search by departure city, destination, or both. Our system automatically includes nearby airports—search "Miami" and see opportunities from **Miami-Opa Locka (OPF)**, **Miami International (MIA)**, and **Fort Lauderdale Executive (FXE)**.

## The Technology Behind the Revolution

### Multi-Source Intelligence
Our radar aggregates data from **12+ major operators and charter brokers**—including industry leaders like **XO**, **NetJets**, **Flexjet**, **VistaJet**, **Air Charter Service**, and **Clay Lacy Aviation**. This represents the most comprehensive empty leg database ever assembled.

### Real-Time Updates
Aircraft positions and availability update **every 15-30 minutes** throughout the day. When a jet becomes available—or gets booked—you'll see the change reflected immediately on the radar.

### Smart Airport Clustering
Our system understands that "New York" means **Teterboro (TEB)**, **Westchester (HPN)**, **Farmingdale (FRG)**, and other regional airports. This intelligent clustering ensures you never miss opportunities due to rigid airport codes.

## Why Flight Radar Changes Everything

### Unprecedented Market Visibility
For decades, empty leg flights existed in silos. Operators posted opportunities on individual websites, private WhatsApp groups, or exclusive broker networks. **Flight Radar breaks down these barriers**, creating the first unified view of empty leg availability across the entire U.S. market.

### Democratized Access to Private Aviation
Previously, finding empty legs required industry connections or significant time investment monitoring multiple sources. Our radar **levels the playing field**, giving every traveler access to the same intelligence that was once reserved for charter brokers and frequent flyers.

### Strategic Trip Planning
See patterns in empty leg availability across different routes and timeframes. **Transcontinental flights** from **Teterboro to Van Nuys** often generate return empty legs—perfect for round-trip planning. **Seasonal routes** to destinations like **Aspen**, **Martha's Vineyard**, and **Jackson Hole** create predictable repositioning opportunities.

## The Corridors That Drive Savings

### East Coast Powerhouses
**Teterboro (TEB)** remains the epicenter of private aviation, generating the highest volume of empty leg opportunities. Our radar reveals the constant flow of aircraft between **NYC and South Florida**—the industry's busiest corridor for repositioning flights.

### Transcontinental Gold Mine
The **TEB to Van Nuys (VNY)** route represents the ultimate empty leg opportunity. Coast-to-coast repositioning flights regularly offer **60-75% savings** off standard charter rates for travelers with flexibility.

### Seasonal Hotspots
Watch patterns emerge as our radar tracks seasonal migrations. **Winter in South Florida** creates northbound empty legs in spring. **Summer in the Hamptons** generates repositioning opportunities as the season winds down.
